## 1. App Name (Max 30 Characters)

Your app name is the most important metadata element for search ranking.

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Front-load with most searchable/important word
- Make it memorable and easy to spell
- Include one high-value keyword if natural
- Keep it pronounceable for word-of-mouth

**Don't:**
- Stuff keywords unnaturally
- Use generic words like "App" or "The"
- Copy competitor names
- Use special characters excessively
- Include pricing (e.g., "Free")

### Examples

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good | Why |
|--------|---------|-----|
| The Best Photo Editor App Free | Snapseed | Clean, memorable, brandable |
| Workout Exercise Fitness Gym | Fitbod | Descriptive yet concise |
| Money Budget Finance Tracker | Copilot | Distinct brand + clear purpose |

### Formula

```
[Brand Name] - [Key Benefit/Category]
```

Examples:
- "Calm - Sleep & Meditation"
- "Duolingo - Language Lessons"
- "Notion - Notes & Docs"

---

## 2. Subtitle (Max 30 Characters)

The subtitle appears below your app name and is indexed for search.

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Complement the name (don't repeat words)
- Include your primary keyword
- Focus on benefit or action
- Use strong verbs

**Don't:**
- Repeat words from app name
- Use generic phrases like "Best App"
- Include version numbers
- Use ALL CAPS

### Examples

| App Name | ❌ Bad Subtitle | ✅ Good Subtitle |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Headspace | Meditation App | Mindful Meditation |
| Mint | Budget Finance Money | Budget & Bill Tracker |
| Strava | Run Bike Exercise | Run, Ride & Swim |

### Formula Options

```
[Action Verb] + [Object/Result]
[Benefit] + [Category]
[Primary Use Case]
```

---

## 3. Keywords (Max 100 Characters)

Keywords are NOT visible to users but heavily influence search ranking.

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use all 100 characters
- Separate with commas (no spaces after commas)
- Include singular OR plural (not both)
- Research competitor keywords
- Include common misspellings
- Use specific long-tail keywords

**Don't:**
- Repeat words from name or subtitle (already indexed)
- Include your app name or company name
- Use competitor brand names (policy violation)
- Include "app" or "free"
- Repeat words (each word indexed once)

### Keyword Research Strategy

1. **Brainstorm** - List all relevant terms
2. **Analyze competitors** - See what top apps rank for
3. **Check search volume** - Use ASO tools if available
4. **Prioritize** - Balance relevance vs. competition
5. **Test** - Monitor rankings and iterate

### Example

For a meditation app:

**Words already indexed (name/subtitle):**
"meditation", "mindful", "sleep"

**Good keyword field:**
```
relax,stress,anxiety,breathing,calm,focus,wellness,mindfulness,guided,sounds,timer,daily,morning,night,peace
```

### Character Counting

| Element | Example | Characters |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Keyword 1 | relax | 5 |
| Comma | , | 1 |
| Keyword 2 | stress | 6 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| **Total** | | ≤100 |

---

## 4. Description (Max 4000 Characters)

### Structure

```
[Hook - First 1-3 sentences visible before "More"]

[Core value proposition]

[Key Features - Bulleted list]

[Social proof if available]

[Call to action]
```

### First Three Lines (Critical)

The first ~170 characters show before the "More" button. Make them count:

**Formula:**
```
[What it does] + [Who it's for] + [Key benefit]
```

**Example:**
> "Todoist helps 30 million people organize work and life. Trusted by teams at Apple, Google, and Netflix. Finally feel in control of your tasks."

### Feature Formatting

Use bullet points or emoji for scanability:

```
FEATURES:
• Smart task scheduling with AI
• Seamless sync across all devices
• Team collaboration tools
• 50+ integrations with popular apps
```

Or with emoji:
```
📅 Smart scheduling
🔄 Cross-device sync
👥 Team collaboration
🔗 50+ integrations
```

### What NOT to Include

- Pricing information
- "New" or version-specific content (use What's New)
- Competitor comparisons
- Excessive keywords
- ALL CAPS text
- URLs (they're not clickable)

---

## 5. Screenshots

Screenshots are your visual sales pitch. First screenshot is most important.

### Required Counts

- **Minimum:** 3 per device size
- **Maximum:** 10 per device size
- **Recommended:** 5-8 (quality over quantity)

### Dimensions Quick Reference

| Device | Portrait | Landscape |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| iPhone 6.7" | 1290×2796 | 2796×1290 |
| iPhone 6.5" | 1284×2778 | 2778×1284 |
| iPhone 5.5" | 1242×2208 | 2208×1242 |
| iPad 12.9" | 2048×2732 | 2732×2048 |

### Screenshot Strategy

| Position | Purpose | Content |
|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Hero shot | Main value proposition |
| 2 | Core feature | Primary functionality |
| 3 | Secondary feature | Key differentiator |
| 4 | Social proof | Reviews, awards, users |
| 5 | Final CTA | Download prompt or bonus feature |

### Design Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use device frames for professionalism
- Add text overlays (readable at small size)
- Show real app UI, not just mockups
- Maintain visual consistency
- Use contrasting colors for text

**Don't:**
- Use text smaller than 30pt equivalent
- Show more than 3-5 words per screenshot
- Include excessive marketing fluff
- Show login screens (unless that's the product)
- Use stock photos unrelated to app

### Text Overlay Formula

```
[Headline: 3-5 words, benefit-focused]
[Optional subheadline: 5-10 words, feature-focused]
```

**Examples:**
- "Sleep Better Tonight" / "AI-powered sleep stories"
- "Never Forget a Task" / "Smart reminders that work"

## 6. App Preview Videos (Optional)

### Specifications

- **Length:** 15-30 seconds
- **Format:** H.264, .mov or .mp4
- **Resolution:** Match screenshot dimensions
- **First frame:** Strong visual (used as poster)

### Content Strategy

**Structure:**
1. Hook (0-5s) - Grab attention
2. Value prop (5-15s) - Show core benefit
3. Features (15-25s) - Demo key functionality
4. CTA (25-30s) - Download prompt

**Don't:**
- Use hands holding devices (outdated style)
- Include audio voiceover (often muted)
- Show loading screens or errors
- Make text too small to read
